![Graphic showing the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/10649427-1e8a53d498235a25.gif?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip "Continuous delivery and continuous deployment - spot the diff!")

 Inspired by [Yassal Sundman's blog post on Crisp's Blog.](http://blog.crisp.se/2013/02/05/yassalsundman/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment) 

While continuous deployment may not be right for every company, continuous delivery is an absolute requirement of [DevOps](https://puppet.com/solutions/devops) practices. Only when you continuously deliver your code can you have true confidence that your changes will be serving value to your customers within minutes of pushing the "go" button, and that you can actually push that button any time the business is ready for it.
